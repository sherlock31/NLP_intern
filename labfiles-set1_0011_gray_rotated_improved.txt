Comments

Fourier Transform lnt'rared Spectroscopy tFTlR) is a technique to determine the composition oi a stone With
respect to the nature and percentage of compounds present in the stone. FTlR has an advantage over other
conventional methods of analysis as the recognition of stone components is more precise and accurate. This
technique recognizes small fractions of multiple components as percentages. present in a stone Whereas

conventional methods recognizes only i ommonly occurring stone components4
